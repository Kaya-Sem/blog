        In my day to day conversations, subjective and objective are being passed around quite often, to frame a certain standpoint or to ground a fact. Only two of these seems little, so I thought, but it turns out there 4!

        not all that glitters is gold¹ Media and digital usage should be a means
        to an end, not an end to means. Certainly, some people do get rich
        and benefit tremendously from it, but it leaves many emotionally
        impoverished. This whole phone and social media thing hasn't been a
        win-win for a very long time. It's a winner takes all situation, with
        the loser always being the end user, leaving them insecure, empty and
        unfulfilled. At best its usually a slippery slope of time-waste, at
        worst a cause for depression, suicide and mental issues. 

        <h4>Digital Goldilocks Zone</h4>
      Why intentional usage is the Goldilocks zone. enough
        to benefit from - but not enough to have a negative impact. Digital media and
        online content has benefits: 

       <ul>
        <li>inspiration</li>
        <li>entertainment</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
      </ul>
      but it has to be consumed in just the right amount, lest you burn yourself. It is up to you to find a
        middle-road that works for you, but when in doubt, it is better to err
        on the side of less rather than more. Whether you endlessly scroll
        feel-good videos, or are addicted to scrolling feeds, you need to think
        about the amount of time you spend on that media, and where the line of
        diminishing returns start. At what point have you maximized your time
        online, and at what point does consuming any more of it not lead to
        anything significant? 

      The online Goldilocks zone is that fine border
        where you benefit most from it, without wasting any extra wasteful time.
        ### Being intentional Recently, I have grown shrewd of black-and-white
        thinking, preferring and enjoying more nuanced ways of evaluating the
        world. As such, I cannot declare these platforms or technology as the
        devil. (inter) Objectively, they do have the ability to improve our
        quality of life. Yet, people are laughably bad at controlling impulses,
        and are easily led by their instinct and intrinsic wiring. A solution I
        found helpful is being intentional. It is almost impossible and quite
        crude to simply avoid it all together. There is no need to completely
        throw out social media and digital consumption, but the way we interact
        with these systems is the culprit. The problem is less in the content
        itself (a symptom) and more in the way it is watched, consumed and
        interacted with. For many, looking from outside in, it has ceased to be
        entertainment or "inspiration", and rather has become a routine. An
        unconscious habit. An addiction, even. Ask yourself the question: What
        do I really want to gain from this interaction? ... Are you really
        scrolling your feed for inspiration like you tell yourself, or has it
        become hard or almost impossible for you to spend any time at all by
        yourself, being bored, or consuming slow media? Be brutally honest with
        yourself. Is it a crutch to fill a void? 

      <h4>How to be intentional</h4> 
      You need to find better ways of consuming and interacting with your
        preferred media. Ways that are less destructive to your day to day life.

        seem archaic, but are still widely used, and may become your best

      <h4>Anti-human design</h4>

        through and through designed with revenue in mind. You are a mere
        product and you do not matter. You are being farmed for screen time, for
        those oh-so-sweet advertiser dollars. Nothing they do is for your
        benefit.
