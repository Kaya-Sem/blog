    **_not all that glitters is gold_** ¹ Media and digital usage should be a
    means to an end, not an end to means. Certainly, **some** people do get rich
    and benefit tremendously from it, but it leaves **many** emotionally
    impoverished. This whole phone and social media thing hasn't been a win-win
    for a very long time. It's a winner takes all situation, with the loser
    always being the end user, leaving them insecure, empty and unfulfilled. At
    best its usually a slippery slope of time-waste, at worst a cause for
    depression, suicide and mental issues. ### Digital Goldilocks Zone ² Why
    intentional usage is the Goldilocks zone. - enough to benefit from - not
    enough to have a negative impact Digital media and online content has many
    benefits: - - - , but it has to be consumed in just the right amount, lest
    you burn yourself. It is up to you to find a middle-road that works for you,
    but when in doubt, it is better to err on the side of less rather than more.
    Whether you endlessly scroll feel-good videos, or are addicted to scrolling
    feeds, you need to think about the amount of time you spend on that media,
    and where the line of diminishing returns start. At what point have you
    maximized your time online, and at what point does consuming any more of it
    not lead to anything significant? The online Goldilocks zone is that fine
    border where you benefit most from it, without wasting any extra wasteful
    time. ### Being intentional Recently, I have grown shrewd of black-and-white
    thinking, preferring and enjoying more nuanced ways of evaluating the world.
    As such, I cannot declare these platforms or technology as the devil.
    (inter) Objectively, they do have the ability to improve our quality of
    life. Yet, people are laughably bad at controlling impulses, and are easily
    led by their instinct and intrinsic wiring. A solution I found helpful is
    being intentional. It is almost impossible and quite crude to simply avoid
    it all together. There is no need to completely throw out social media and
    digital consumption, but the way we interact with these systems is the
    culprit. The problem is less in the content itself (a symptom) and more in
    the way it is watched, consumed and interacted with. For many, looking from
    outside in, it has ceased to be entertainment or "inspiration", and rather
    has become a routine. An unconscious habit. An addiction, even. Ask yourself
    the question: What do I really want to gain from this interaction? ... Are
    you really scrolling your feed for inspiration like you tell yourself, or
    has it become hard or almost impossible for you to spend any time at all by
    yourself, being bored, or consuming slow media? Be brutally honest with
    yourself. Is it a crutch to fill a void? ### How to be intentional You need
    to find better ways of consuming and interacting with your preferred media.
    Ways that are less destructive to your day to day life. We need to get away
    as far as possible from the algorithms. Here are some ways you you can
    manage various services and media: **Dumbphones** you can do anything, but

    seem archaic, but are still widely used, and may become your best friend.
    They allow you to be very picky about what you are being presented. ###
    Anti-humane design The software and algorithms are through and through
    designed with revenue in mind. You are a mere product and you do not matter.
    You are being farmed for screen time, for those oh-so-sweet advertiser
    dollars. Nothing they do is for your benefit. --- ### Opinions ---
