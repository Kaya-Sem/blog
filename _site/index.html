<h2>Digital Minimalism</h2>
<p><p>Not all that glitters is gold Media and digital usage should be a means
to an end, not an end to means. Certainly, some people do get rich and
benefit tremendously from it, but it leaves many emotionally
impoverished. This whole phone and social media thing hasn't been a
win-win for a very long time. It's a winner takes all situation, with
the loser always being the end user, leaving them insecure, empty and
unfulfilled. At best its usually a slippery slope of time-waste, at
worst a cause for depression, suicide and mental issues.</p>
<h4>Digital Goldilocks Zone</h4>
<p>Why intentional usage is the Goldilocks zone. enough to benefit from -
but not enough to have a negative impact. Digital media and online
content has benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>inspiration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>entertainment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Milk</p>
<p>but it has to be consumed in just the right amount, lest you burn
yourself. It is up to you to find a middle-road that works for you, but
when in doubt, it is better to err on the side of less rather than more.
Whether you endlessly scroll feel-good videos, or are addicted to
scrolling feeds, you need to think about the amount of time you spend on
that media, and where the line of diminishing returns start. At what
point have you maximized your time online, and at what point does
consuming any more of it not lead to anything significant? The online
Goldilocks zone is that fine border where you benefit most from it,
without wasting any extra wasteful time. ### Being intentional Recently,
I have grown shrewd of black-and-white thinking, preferring and enjoying
more nuanced ways of evaluating the world. As such, I cannot declare
these platforms or technology as the devil. (inter) Objectively, they do
have the ability to improve our quality of life. Yet, people are
laughably bad at controlling impulses, and are easily led by their
instinct and intrinsic wiring. A solution I found helpful is being
intentional. It is almost impossible and quite crude to simply avoid it
all together. There is no need to completely throw out social media and
digital consumption, but the way we interact with these systems is the
culprit. The problem is less in the content itself (a symptom) and more
in the way it is watched, consumed and interacted with. For many,
looking from outside in, it has ceased to be entertainment or
&quot;inspiration&quot;, and rather has become a routine. An unconscious habit. An
addiction, even. Ask yourself the question: What do I really want to
gain from this interaction? ... Are you really scrolling your feed for
inspiration like you tell yourself, or has it become hard or almost
impossible for you to spend any time at all by yourself, being bored, or
consuming slow media? Be brutally honest with yourself. Is it a crutch
to fill a void?</p>
<p>How to be intentional
You need to find better ways of consuming and interacting with your
preferred media. Ways that are less destructive to your day to day life.
