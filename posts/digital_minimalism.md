Not all that glitters is gold Media and digital usage should be a means
to an end, not an end to means. Certainly, some people do get rich and
benefit tremendously from it, but it leaves many emotionally
impoverished. This whole phone and social media thing hasn't been a
win-win for a very long time. It's a winner takes all situation, with
the loser always being the end user, leaving them insecure, empty and
unfulfilled. At best its usually a slippery slope of time-waste, at
worst a cause for depression, suicide and mental issues.

#### Online media is a double-edged sword, and we suck at swordwielding

- Many benefits, but oh so many downsides, so that for many it should not be worth it, yet they are coerced.

But it has to be consumed in just the right amount, lest you burn
yourself. It is up to you to find a middle-road that works for you, but
when in doubt, it is better to err on the side of less rather than more.
Whether you endlessly scroll feel-good videos, or are addicted to
scrolling feeds, you need to think about the amount of time you spend on
that media, and where the line of diminishing returns start. At what
point have you maximized your time online, and at what point does
consuming any more of it not lead to anything significant? The online
Goldilocks zone is that fine border where you benefit most from it,
without wasting any extra wasteful time. ### Being intentional Recently,
I have grown shrewd of black-and-white thinking, preferring and enjoying
more nuanced ways of evaluating the world. As such, I cannot declare
these platforms or technology as the devil. (inter) Objectively, they do
have the ability to improve our quality of life. Yet, people are
laughably bad at controlling impulses, and are easily led by their
instinct and intrinsic wiring.

#### Digital Goldilocks Zone

Everyone, especially young people, should strive for a healthy, balanced digital presence. I call it the digital goldilocks zone.  It's a zone where you to reap all the benefits of technology, and more specifically, online media, while avoiding the psychological, relational and physically harmful effects of overuse and unwanted exposure.

To get yourself into this zone, you have to ask youtself some analytical questions. These are meantt to sketch your intended usage and your actual behavior. 

Once we have that clear picture, you can take action to alter the unwanted behavior and act more intentional.

You could see intentional media consumption as a rough hewn block of marble. You can shave and sculpt it in such a way that the only thing left is a magnificent piece of habits and systems meticoulsly designed to maximuise your relationship with technology.

The best tool in your arsenal is being intentional, and setup up your environments to cater to that. It is almost impossible and quite crude to simply avoid it all together. I also think there is no need to completely throw out social media and
digital consumption. The way we interact with these systems is the
real culprit. The problem is less in the content itself (a symptom) and more
in the way it is watched, consumed and interacted with. For many,
looking from outside in, it has ceased to be entertainment or
"inspiration", and rather has become a routine. An unconscious habit. An
addiction, even. Ask yourself the question: What do I really want to
gain from this interaction? ... Are you really scrolling your feed for
inspiration like you tell yourself, or has it become hard or almost
impossible for you to spend any time at all by yourself, being bored, or
consuming slow media? Be brutally honest with yourself. Is it a crutch
to fill a void?

#### How to be intentional

You need to find better ways of consuming and interacting with your
preferred media. Ways that are less destructive to your life.

First, here are a few categories of digital media, ranked from worst to best

1. Short-form content e.g. Tiktok, reels
2. algorithmic heavy content e.g. Youtube
3. Soft algos, like spotify and pinterest.

When you analyse your digital media constumption, you should pay most attention to these more harmfull activities, as they have the biggest impact on your welbeing and time. I think we can all agree that a tiktokaddiction is way worse that a spotify addiction, in terms of psychological impact.


**Some questions to ask yourself**

- How much time do I want to spend with technology and digital media today?
- How many hours a day do I spend on these categories?
- What do I hope to gain from your interactions with this digital media?
- What did you actually get from these interactions?
- Why do you think you keep going back to this routine?

Through and through designed with revenue in mind. You are a mere
