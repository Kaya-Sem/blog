An problem modern phones and mp3 players pose is that they allow us to listen to music at any time of the day, anywhere. In between activities, while waiting for public transport, on public transport, in queues and while walking.

You might not think this is an issue. Unfortunatly for you, it probably is.

The problem is threefold. First and foremost, it puts you in a bubble wherein you dissallow most forms of spontainious interaction socially and with your environment. You yourself are less approachable and will probably talk to no one, ever. TODO: explain why this is important.

Secondly, you give your precious cranium no downtime whatsoever. Your brain is not a computer. You thus cannot handle it as such. It does not keep chugging all day long. It is a muscle you have to rest like any other. While sleep does a fine job, you need more. Humans through the ages have had this mental downtime. You, however, do not have this luxury.not. When you constantly distract yourself with streams of music, podcasts and audiobooks, you destroy the solitude of the brain. You crush its ability to think of itself (meta-awareness), ongoing events and other things you ought to process during the day.

By allowing frequent "off-time", where you don't distract yourself with music or any other artifical stimuli, you allow yourself to process suppressed feelings and other happenings. A side benefit is that it allows you to be bored. You need to do your research if you do not already realize the importance of it. Learn why being bored is a superpower. Boredom is a source of inspiration.

Lastly, it dilutes the art of music to a lesser form. By "saving" up your music for later, you get to appreciate the music that much more, when you sit down for it and it alone. I am not saying that you should listen to less music, I am saying that you should be more intentional about *when* and *how* you listen to it. You will get more enyojement out the music itself, and you will get more enjoyment friom the times you are not listening to it. A clear net gain across the board. You should refrain from indulging whenever, and set aside some time where you can give the music your full attention. You will be impressed about how it improves your experience.


It can sound hard or even absurd, to abstain from music. You might not think it all that bad. You might be afraid to be alone with your own thought. I think of you a whiny bitch for that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

After a short while of this abstenence, this withdrawal period, the rejection of this constant syringe of mind-numbing, intelectualism rotting music habit in your bum, you get used to it. Life goes back to normal. Back to the status quo. You do not even crave the stimulus anymore. Anecdotally, I can report many improvements and benefits. I've become atleast a magnitude more social, I feel more grounded in reality, and more a part of it, instead of merely surfing on it's waves. Downtime teaches you to value the small things, which is a little cheatcode to being content in life.
