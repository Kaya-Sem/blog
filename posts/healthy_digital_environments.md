**How to create healthy digital environments that encourage thoughfull interaction**


When you absolutely cannot get rid of algorithmic content feeds, you should try the tactic of piping it into other forms of media. One of my favourite ones is the *RSS*-feed. Is a handly little dinosaur technology that still reigns king over the smart internet people. It allows you to take certain streams of content, like blogs, youtube channels, newswebsites, etc and condense it, package it for use elsewhere.

With this approach, you avoid having to visit the platform from wich the content originates, but still have acces to the content that you desire.

For example:

If you struggle with a youtube addiction, and cold turkey quiting is just not in the books, and option is to analyse which channels you actually want to see, put those into an RSS feed to your email or an rss reader. This would mean you can still watch your videos, without being suggested anytthing else. You can have your cake, and eat it too.


Other ways  are blocking methods. For youtube there are a few handy plugins that allow you to remove suggested videos, the homepage, etc. These works wonders so long you can manage to to turn the extension of.
